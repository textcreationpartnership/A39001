            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

betweene the King and Parliament in England; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall I have thought it
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to informe you how the caſe ſtands with us in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. For
the Rebels they increaſe daily, like <hi>Hydra's</hi> heads; one is no
ſooner cut off, but there ariſe three in his place; but God be thanked they
want Armes to furniſh them; by which meanes (though their Forces are very
conſiderable) they are not invincible; for ſeverall aſſaults have been
made againſt them, upon great oddes on their ſide; yet ſo great is Gods
mercy towards us, that notwithſtanding their numbers, our handfull have
ſtill the victory, comming off with little <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45523:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 54 -->loſſe, they being killed by thouſands. For our
ſouldiers, though their habits are poore, yet they have good hearts, for they
weigh neither danger nor death, but upon all occaſions are forwarder to fall
on then their Commanders are to have them.</p>
            <p>For example, the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> with 5000. Foot and
800. Horſe fought with 15000 Rebels neere <hi>Kilkenni,</hi> where the Rebels
are incamped, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at leaſt 3000. with the loſſe of 60. Foot and 20.
Horſe.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Titchbourne</hi> before <hi>Dundalke</hi> fought
with <hi>Rorum Maguiers</hi> (brother to the Lo: <hi>Maguiers</hi> now
priſoner in the Tower) having but three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot and two Troops of
Horſe, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiers</hi> having above a thouſand Rebels: in which fight
Sir <hi>Henry Titchbourne</hi> behaved himſelfe ſo valiantly, that had not
<hi>Maguiers</hi> beſtirred himſelf very nimbly, he had accompanied his
brother: for his valiant followers ſhewed him a faire paire of heeles, and
left him to fight it out by himſelfe; which he ſeeing, followed their
example, and ran away for company.</p>
            <p>In this battaile there were killed neere 2000. Rebels, 20.
Priſoners taken, which were hanged like Rebels as they were. Sir
<hi>Chriſtopher Loftus.</hi> hath cleared the Coaſt of <hi>Galway,</hi> it
having long time been beſieged by the Rebels; but being oft times worſted
by the Engliſh Forces, and gauled by the often iſſuing out of the
Citizens, they were forced to ſteale away by night. But Sir <hi>Chriſtopher
Loftus</hi> having diſcovered them, fell upon them 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45523:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 54 -->on the morrow as they marched
towards a wood that was neere adjoyning, thinking there to ſecure
themſelves; but ſeeing themſelves intercepted, they fronted the
Engliſh, who gave them a ſowre welcome. The Engliſh were ſtraight
ſeconded by the Citizens of <hi>Galway,</hi> at whoſe arrivall the Rebels
began to be amazed, and in a confuſed manner ran into diſordor: In which
confuſion they were cut off ſo faſt that they found the place too hot for
their company. Wherefore inſtead of fighting, they tooke themſelves to
running, leaving the engliſh and the Citizens of Galway to congratulate their
happy victory.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Gibs</hi> was lately hard beſet at Garmaſton

ſeverall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles beſieged by the Rebells; and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate he made
Garmaſton his quarters intending to ſtay there a day or two to refreſh
his men, and to give them time to mend their clothes which were very bad: But
<hi>Philome Oneale</hi> having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teligence that there was a ſmall company of
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh in Garmaſton under the command of Cap. <hi>Gibs,</hi> marched
through the wood privately, ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Towne, but being diſcovered
by the Engliſh, certain notice was immediately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Captain
<hi>Gibs,</hi> who ſent immediately to Captain <hi>Bartlet,</hi> who was then
in Limricke Caſtle, deſiring him to ſend him ſome preſent aid,
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he and his men had beene loſt. <hi>Philome Oneale</hi> 
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45523:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 55 -->having ſurpriſed him in his
quarters, nevertheleſſe, Garmaſton having a little Caſtle in it, hee
had planted to ſmall field pieces which he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept him ſome
ſmall time, likewiſe placing his men to his beſt advantage, to offend him
and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelfe.</p>
            <p>This being done as ſoone as <hi>Pwilome Oneale</hi> came
within ſhot of the Towne, he cauſed his men to give a generall ſhoute,
which <hi>Oneale</hi> hearing feared ſome treachery, whereupon hee made a
ſtand, all this while Captain <hi>Gibs</hi> ſtood not ſtill, for his
field pieces and other ſmall ſhot with the drums made ſuch a confuſed
melody, that the Rebells were almoſt amazed, fearing that they had beene
almoſt betrayed to death, they not conceiving any other cauſe of joy could
be at ſuch a time ſo vehemently expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Thus both parties continued ſhooting for the ſpace of two
howers.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Gibs</hi> his men ſhooting at a full body, did
doe great execution amongſt them, but the rebells ſhooting at randome
ſcarce frighted the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>At length Captain <hi>Bartlet</hi> with 500. foot and 3. troopes
of horſe, marched through the wood for the more privacie, and before they
were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware clapt juſt upon the reare of the Rebels, which <hi>Oneale</hi>
ſeeing; cauſed his men to wheele about, and to front Captain
<hi>Bartlet,</hi> who having the advantage of the hill, fronted them both
(knowing his men to be of an approved courage) <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45523:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 55 -->and
gave them a hot charge with muſquet bullet. In the meane time Captain
<hi>Gibs</hi> drew out his men and planted them juſt at the bottome of the
hill, ſhooting very faſt, ſo that betweene them they cauſed them to
retreate, diſcharging on the flanke. Which they having done, being cleare of
both the parties of Engliſh, they very fairly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched away with ſpeede,
with the loſſe of 500. men. In this Skirmiſh Captain <hi>Gibs</hi> was
ſhot through the arme with a muſquet bullet, and loſt neere 100. men</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Greenwel</hi> fought with <hi>Mac-mahaun</hi>
